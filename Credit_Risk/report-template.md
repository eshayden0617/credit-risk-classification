## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, the goal was to build machine learning models for predicting loan status, specifically differentiating between "healthy loans" (0) and "high-risk loans" (1). I utilized financial data, including variables like credit scores, loan amounts, and employment length, to make these predictions.

The Machine Learning Process Was:
1. Handling missing data and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
2. Chose Logistic Regression model for the classification task
3. Trained the model on the training data
4. Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results

* Logistic Regression Model:
  * Balanced Accuracy: 0.95
  * Precision for Class 0 (Healthy Loans): 1.00
  * Precision for Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): 0.85
  * Recall for Class 0 (Healthy Loans): 0.99
  * Recall for Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): 0.91



## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
